      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wanted to dive into history but didn’t know where to start? We live in such a beautiful world with so much history sitting right in our own backyard, but figuring out where all these historical sites are can be intimidating. That’s where I come in. With my website, I aim to take the confusion and guesswork out of the process so you can find all the best historical sites all around you. After all, there’s no better way to experience the world than to get up close and personal with it — that is, if you know where to look.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Color Palette

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/palette/780000-c1121f-fdf0d5-003049-669bbc" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/palette/780000-c1121f-fdf0d5-003049-669bbc</a>

      <p>
        History is one of the few things that is everywhere. Wherever we go, someone has been there or something has happened there in the past. Have you ever stood somewhere and wondered who else has stood in that exact same place? Or why that area is so significant? With this website, those questions can be answered at the click of a button. Here at Landmark Radar, we strive to provide the historical significance of nearby areas, memorials, and monuments. With that, we also provide nearby locations that have a historical significance with a brief description of the history behind them. In order to have the best experience with this website, you will need to enter the zip code, city, or state that you are currently in, and the website can provide local historical attractions. As long as the website has the location, you can see where the nearest memorial, monument, or historical attraction is. If you are not in the area you would like to explore, you can find historical sites by simply typing in the general area you intend to explore. We will provide the best and easiest experience so you can focus more on the history and less on the headache of finding it!

      </ul>
      <h3>Historical Sites & Images</h3>
      <p>
        The audience should be able to enter the general area of where they reside or intend to reside (city, state, or zip), and, using GPS, the website will provide local historical locations and a brief description of why it is classified as a historical site. This website needs to be focused on ease and simplicity so the audience can focus on the history of an area instead of figuring out the website, so user friendliness is key. Aesthetics are always important as well so the audience will be appreciative of how it looks and will be more likely to return to the website in the future. Images should be included on the website, somehow showing photos of the historical sites. This could be in the form of one current photo and one image of the historical event or person behind the significance of the area so the audience can have visual aids for what happened there. Due to the site being focused on American history, the site should be themed likewise: American flag color palette, images on the page, and even some information on the general history of America. This site is for educational purposes, so it’s important to provide accurate information and maybe even some historical documents for the audience to read.

      </ul>
      <h3>Historical Documents</h3>
      <p>
        This site should provide historical sites, information accessible to the public, and historical documents that can increase the understanding of the historical significance of a site for the user. The site will be for those who are seeking more knowledge about the history around them, historical enthusiasts, and those who want to learn more for fun. It will not include theme parks, outdoor activities, haunted attractions, or city marks (state capitols, schools, libraries, etc.) unless they hold historical significance. The site should not be biased in any way; it should be entirely informational and historically accurate without opinion-based statements or blocked-out information. The site may also include websites for museums or informational sites to help guide the audience in the direction to learn more about a historical site. This site will not be providing information that’s too in-depth, leading the audience to perform their own research, but the site will be focused on providing enough information to spark the interest of the user. Due to the site being focused on American history, it will be limited to American history only; history about other countries will be excluded unless there is a direct relation to the development of American history.
