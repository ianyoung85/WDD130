    <p>Hello class! My name is Ian (As seen above) and I am from Olympia Washington.
        I am persuing a degree in Computer Information and Technology and I would like to be a software developer someday!
        I just got married last August to my amazing wife! I am currently working in project management 
        for a solar panel company in Rexburg! The thing I love most about BYUI is the friendly culture! 
        I love that it isn't super competitive and everyone here is so kind!
    </p>
