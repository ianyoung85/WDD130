            <h2>One Small Step</h2>
            <p>The United States of America has been through so much. It has seen wars, depressions, 
                development, and even a man on the moon! Remembering our great accomplishments as a nation can help us
                avoid the bad things and move toward the good things and make even greater strides toward a more perfect union.  </p>

            <h2>Where We've Been</h2>
            <p>Why should we remember our history and those who built this country? As Robert Heinlein once said, "A generation which ignores history
                has no past and no future." We should always strive to remember our roots so we can learn and grow as individuals and as a nation. 
                We have been given the chance to build this country to an even higher place than where it began, and we shouldn't forget what brought us up in history, 
                and what brought us down. </p>
